<h1>Predicting NBA Match Outcomes Using Halftime Data</h1>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
This project analyzes NBA game data to explore how halftime performance relates to final game outcomes. Using shot-level and scoring information aggregated by quarter, the analysis focuses on determining whether the halftime score can serve as a reliable predictor of victory, and how consistently the leading team maintains its advantage until the end of the game.
By combining data aggregation, statistical modeling, and visualization, this project aims to answer:
How strongly does a halftime lead influence the final outcome of an NBA game?
Can simple performance metrics, such as halftime point differential, accurately predict game results?
Do more complex machine learning models, like Random Forest, outperform simpler approaches such as Logistic Regression in this context?
